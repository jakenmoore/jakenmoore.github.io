      <description>It is the first of December today and I am going to get a jump start on 2021 goals by beginning Project 8. This is an idea I got from one of the fast promoting doctors I watch on YouTube. She recommends, for certain people, a program where one fasts for 72 hours every week for eight weeks. Since I have done a 14 day fast, without too many issues, I think this sounds like a good challenge and a great way to get towards my fitness goals.</description>
