      <description>Killing Commendatore by Murakami Haruki 4/5 I think I have read every book by Murakami. I started when I was in my mid-20s, about 20 years ago, before I moved to Tokyo and before I knew anything about Japan. I read the books in chronological order and I can not say I have liked them all. In any book, when a character dreams, or when the story departs into magic realism, I tend to zone out.</description>
