      <description>It is the first of December today and I am going to get a jump start on 2021 goals by beginning Project 8. This is an idea I got from one of the fast promoting doctors I watch on YouTube. She recommends, for certain people, a program where one fasts for 72 hours every week for eight weeks. Since I have done a 14 day fast, without too many issues, I think this sounds like a good challenge and a great way to get towards my fitness goals.</description>

      <title>300 Swings Challenge</title>

      <description>I have just finished the 300 swings a day for 30 days kettlebell challenge. It is a straightforward enough challenge; do 300 swings a day with one or two arms for 30 days. Men should use a 24kg bell and women 16kg. You can do the 300 in any combination of reps and sets throughout the day.
I have been working out with kettlebells fairly consistently, 2-4 sessions a week, for the last six months.</description>
