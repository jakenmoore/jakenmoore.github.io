      <description>I have just finished the 300 swings a day for 30 days kettlebell challenge. It is a straightforward enough challenge; do 300 swings a day with one or two arms for 30 days. Men should use a 24kg bell and women 16kg. You can do the 300 in any combination of reps and sets throughout the day.
I have been working out with kettlebells fairly consistently, 2-4 sessions a week, for the last six months.</description>

      <description>Killing Commendatore by Murakami Haruki 4/5 I think I have read every book by Murakami. I started when I was in my mid-20s, about 20 years ago, before I moved to Tokyo and before I knew anything about Japan. I read the books in chronological order and I can not say I have liked them all. In any book, when a character dreams, or when the story departs into magic realism, I tend to zone out.</description>
