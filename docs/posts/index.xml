      <description>I have just finished the 300 swings a day for 30 days kettlebell challenge. It is a straightforward enough challenge; do 300 swings a day with one or two arms for 30 days. Men should use a 24kg bell and women 16kg. You can do the 300 in any combination of reps and sets throughout the day.
I have been working out with kettlebells fairly consistently, 2-4 sessions a week, for the last six months.</description>
