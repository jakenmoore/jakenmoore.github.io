### Metropolis by Philip Kerr 5/5
It is with such a heavy heart that I finished Metropolis. I found Philip Kerr via the trilogy 'Berlin Noir', a long time ago, I am not sure when exactly but I think in the early 2000s. I have since read every book in the Bernie Gunther series and I have loved every one. I have read all the works by a number of authors but this series is about my favorite. It is set between about 1932 and 1955 and features a Philip Marlowe-esque German detective Bernie Gunther. All of the books are both comfortingly similar and unique at the same time.

Metropolis is the last in the series and Philip Kerr died of cancer two years ago. When someone has been with one for such a long period, it is hard not to really feel their death. Kerr taught me so much about history, writing and the character of Bernie Gunther is so brilliant and complex.

The book in set in Berlin in the final year or so before the fall of democracy to Nazism. There are hints of what is to come, but the book is a proper detective story. Sadly, I could feel that Kerr didn't put all he wanted into the book and the end is a little rushed. At the same time, I could almost feel Kerr's pain in the pages, particularly as the book wore on. I've given it 5/5 for my love of his work and for my great sadness at it's end. 

Rest in peace Philip.
