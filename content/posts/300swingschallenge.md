I have just finished the 300 swings a day for 30 days kettlebell challenge.
It is a straightforward enough challenge; do 300 swings a day with one or two arms
for 30 days. Men should use a 24kg bell and women 16kg. You can do the 300 in
any combination of reps and sets throughout the day.

I have been working out with kettlebells fairly consistently, 2-4 sessions a week,
for the last six months. I have done a fair few swings, but never close to 300 in
a day and certainly not with a 24kg bell. The hardest pure swings set I did was
10x10 with two 16kg bells, one in each hand (that is a great workout for me).

So I would say my preparation for 300 a day with 24kg was not perfect and I don't
recommend it. Far better would be to build up weight, sets and reps. In addition,
I started the 300 in as tough a way as possible, doing a workout of 20 reps each
minute on the minute for 15 minutes. This was very tough. The next day I felt tired.

For the first week the challenge was a little draining. I switched to 20 sets of
15, emom, so it was a nice 20 minute workout. My lower back felt tired during
a number of the sets each day and I had a few 'uh-oh' moments when my back felt
very weak and tired.

However, after about ten days, things settled down into a nice rhythm. I did my 300
swings at the end of the day, around 4pm, and often added in some supplemental
exercises. For the most part though, I just did the 300 swings in 20 mins.

In terms of effects, I am quite surprised at the results. I haven't worked on my
diet so my weight seems constant. But I am feeling a lot stronger. From my buttocks,
up through my lower back to my shoulders and arms feels solid as a rock. The
300 themselves got substantially easier through the 30 days and by the end were
relatively easy.

I think this shows, about all, three things. One, limits on the body are largely
self-imposed. Two, the body adapts very quickly, if it is not injured, by new
stress. Third, and most important, it shows the power of consistent training
pretty much everyday. In the past when I have put in weeks or months of super
consistency, the results have been similarly good. When I go back to 2-3 times
a week, the results are mediocre.

Where to go from here? I think BJJ is a possibility again, with a gym open in
Hoboken. Therefore I am thinking I will start training there this week. In terms
of kettlebells, I am really enjoying it, so I am going to continue. I think I con
handle 300 swings a day from now on - maybe some days I will do it with 16kg
if I feel beaten up. Yesterday I did a new 300, which was about a 500. 300 swings
with 24kg, 50 pushups, 75 curls with 16kg and then 100 snatches with 16kg.

I think 500 might be the new 300 a day.
