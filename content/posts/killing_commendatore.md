### Killing Commendatore by Murakami Haruki 4/5
I think I have read every book by Murakami. I started when I was in my mid-20s, about 20 years ago, before I moved to Tokyo and before I knew anything about Japan. I read the books in chronological order and I can not say I have liked them all. In any book, when a character dreams or when the story departs into magic realism, I tend to zone out. I don't know why, it doesn't work for me.

The last few Murakami books have not strayed too much into magic realism, or at least have done so in a limited way. I have loved his last few books, especially 1Q84 so I started Killing Commendatore with hopes of another good one. The strange thing is, it has taken me a long time to get through it. A number of months, dipping in and out. I have had too many different books on the go at the same time and I have been distracted. I knuckled down a few weeks ago with this book and read the last 400 pages quickly.

What is there to say about this book? I think it is beautifully written. Still waters run deep, and they do in this book. One of the themes, maybe the main theme, of the book is loss, dealt with it with a Japanese dignity. The characters of the book are somewhat familiar and there is a real plot to the story.The Commendatore character is great and the character of the elderly painter somehow permeates the book even though we never hear him speak.

All in all I really enjoyed the book and I find each paragraph that Murakami writes to be a mini-masterclass in writing. I would say that this is a 4/5 book for me though. There was a little too much magic realism. There is not much of a conclusion to the plot, at least things are left vague. Finally, I was a little uncomfortable with his female characters, who were not that well constructed and some of the Lolita-esque descriptions of the 13 year old girl were off base, for me.
