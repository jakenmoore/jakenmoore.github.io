It is the first of December today and I am going to get a jump start on 2021 goals by beginning Project 8. This is an idea I got from one of the fast promoting doctors I watch on YouTube. She recommends, for certain people, a program where one fasts for 72 hours every week for eight weeks. Since I have done a 14 day fast, without too many issues, I think this sounds like a good challenge and a great way to get towards my fitness goals. I am going to get going with a 72 hour fast starting tomorrow morning (Wednesday), running to Saturday night. I will then do Sunday to Wednesday next week, and the same for the remaining six weeks. Last time I did a fast I only consumed keto approved electrolyte pills - quite a lot of them each day - to maintain cell function. This time I am going to drink black coffee and take the same pills. I will be drinking huge amounts of water each day.

For the rest of the week I will absolutely minimize the amount of sugar I eat so that each Monday I get as little 'keto flu' as possible. I think I need to bite the bullet and not drink alcohol for the entire period as well. I have a bit of dread about this aspect, especially over the Christmas period, but it will be so good for my health and by not drinking I will guarantee a very large drop in body fat.

I will continue to follow my 90 day weight lifting program, even if it is tough on one or two days a week. Basically, I will be shredded after eight weeks :).

Fasting has a number of physiological benefits, maybe I will write about them, such as autophagy. Just as important for me is the mental aspect. I will write about this more. Wish me luck.
